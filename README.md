# Flow9
Development of a POC to play music according to the situation/flow.
Often times, on long drives, there is a feeling that the music may not be suiting the vibe. For instance, you may be on a clear stretch of road and have complete
liberty to step on the gas. However, there is a soothing piano music playing in the background thanks to the playlist that you set at the start of the drive or because
of the late night radio. And the opposite stands true as well - You are stuck in peak traffic listening to hard banging rock music. 
The same use case can arise while working out, running or hiking as well where in the music might not be in sync with your body.
I personally have faced this annoyance and changed the music manually to get in the groove. 
Keeping all this in mind, our project is to develop an application that will play the right song for the situation. Yes, simply setting a playlist according
to your mood will do the job most of the times, but the intention is to have a more intelligent and refined way to select the right song with little manual intervention.
